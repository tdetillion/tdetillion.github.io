            <h1>401(k) & IRA Overview</h1>

            <section class="content-section">
                <p>If you want to build wealth, tax-advantaged retirement accounts are your most powerful tools. The difference between investing in a regular brokerage account and using a 401(k) or IRA isn't just a few percentage points—over decades, it can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars in your pocket instead of the IRS's.</p>

                <p>This overview explains what these accounts are, why they matter, and how to use them together effectively. For detailed information on each account type, see our focused guides below.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-landmark"></i> What Are Tax-Advantaged Accounts?</h2>

                <p>Tax-advantaged accounts are investment accounts that get special treatment from the IRS. Instead of paying taxes on every dividend and capital gain along the way, your money grows either tax-deferred (you pay taxes later) or tax-free (you never pay taxes on the growth).</p>

                <p>There are two main types:</p>

                <p><strong>401(k)</strong> — An employer-sponsored account where contributions come directly from your paycheck. Many employers match a percentage of what you contribute, which is essentially free money. The 2024 contribution limit is $23,000.</p>

                <p><strong>IRA</strong> — An account you open yourself at a brokerage. You have complete control over your investment choices, and it's available to anyone with earned income. The 2024 contribution limit is $7,000.</p>

                <p>Both account types come in Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free growth) versions, giving you flexibility in how you manage your tax situation.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-handshake"></i> How 401(k)s and IRAs Work Together</h2>

                <p>These accounts aren't competing options—they're complementary tools that work best when used together. Here's why:</p>

                <p><strong>Different strengths:</strong> Your 401(k) offers employer matching and higher contribution limits. Your IRA offers more investment choices and potentially better fund options with lower fees.</p>

                <p><strong>Combined tax benefits:</strong> You can contribute to both a 401(k) and an IRA in the same year, maximizing your tax-advantaged space. In 2024, that's up to $30,000 combined ($23,000 + $7,000).</p>

                <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Having both accounts gives you options. You can balance between Traditional (tax-deferred) and Roth (tax-free) contributions based on your current and expected future tax situation.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-list-ol"></i> Priority Order: Where to Put Your Money First</h2>

                <p>If you're wondering which account to fund first, here's the general priority order that makes sense for most people:</p>

                <p><strong>1. 401(k) up to employer match:</strong> This is free money. If your employer matches 50% up to 6% of your salary, contribute at least 6%. Anything less is leaving money on the table.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Max out Roth IRA:</strong> After getting the full employer match, shift focus to maxing out your Roth IRA ($7,000/year). You have more investment options in an IRA than in most 401(k) plans, and the tax-free growth is valuable.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Max out remaining 401(k):</strong> Once your Roth IRA is maxed, go back to your 401(k) and contribute more—ideally up to the $23,000 annual limit if you can afford it.</p>

                <p>This order prioritizes free money first (employer match), then tax-free growth (Roth IRA), then additional tax-deferred savings (401(k)). It's not the only way to do it, but it's a solid default strategy.</p>

                <h2><i class="fa-solid fa-clipboard-check"></i> Action Steps</h2>

                <p>Here's what to do next:</p>

                <p><strong>Check your 401(k) situation:</strong> Does your employer offer a 401(k)? If yes, are you contributing at least enough to get the full match? If not, log into your HR portal today and increase your contribution percentage.</p>

                <p><strong>Open a Roth IRA:</strong> If you don't have one already, open a Roth IRA at Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. The process takes about 15 minutes. You can start with whatever amount you're comfortable with—even $100/month adds up over time.</p>

                <p><strong>Set up automatic contributions:</strong> The easiest way to build wealth is to automate it. Set up automatic transfers from your checking account to your Roth IRA every month. You won't miss money you never see.</p>

                <p><strong>Invest the money:</strong> Don't let cash sit in your retirement accounts earning nothing. Pick a simple, low-cost index fund and invest your contributions. If you're not sure where to start, a target-date fund or a total stock market index fund are both solid choices.</p>

                <p>The sooner you start, the more time your money has to compound. A dollar invested at 25 is worth significantly more at 65 than a dollar invested at 35. Don't wait.</p>
